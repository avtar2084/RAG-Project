This function retrieves relevant context from the FAISS index based on the user's query and generates an answer using the preprocessed transcript. It first checks if the transcript has been fetched; if not, it fetches and processes the transcript from the provided YouTube video URL.

If the transcript is available and a user question is provided, the function proceeds to chunk the transcript for better context retrieval. It then sets up IBM Watson credentials and initializes the watsonx LLM specifically for Q&A tasks.

Next, it creates a FAISS index using the chunked transcript and sets up the Q&A prompt template and chain. Finally, it generates an answer to the user's question using the FAISS index and returns the answer. If the transcript hasn't been fetched or if the user fails to provide a valid question, the function returns a relevant message indicating the issue.
